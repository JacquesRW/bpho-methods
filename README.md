# bpho-methods
A collection of methods for the BPhO 2022 Computational Challenge.

### Contains:
- euler's method: recommended (read: mandated) by BPhO
- neural network: gives 'wobbly' results, needs further work (if worth it) and c++ implementation (maybe fortran instead for matmul)
- rk4 method: extremely pog improvement

### Other:
- 'py_ref.py' contains roughly equivalent python code to the c++ code used for euler and rk4
